## A Little About Me

I am Areej Mulla. I am a Master of Science in Operations and Technology Management (MSOTM) student with a passion for cybersecurity. I underwent on-the-job training at one of IBM’s world regional centers in Cairo, developing various analytical, programming and leadership skills. My career includes working at one of the top 5 largest energy companies in the Middle East and North Africa. During that time, I obtained a professional certificate in Essentials of Cybersecurity from the University of Washington. Currently, I am a member of Women in Cyber Security, Cyber Oregon and PDX Women in Tech.
